My Battleship
==============

Simple Battle Ship Game  
I am learning to code and found a simple Battle Ship game with one ship in Code Academy. Using their basic idea I decided to create a player vs. computer game with five ships on both sides. I am using Python 3 with the Pygame module

The latest version, battleship5 has 5 ships created for the computer player, these are visible for editing purposes and will be invisible in the final version. The player must drag and drop his ships into place and use the space bar to change orientation. 

Still to come: prevent the ships from going beyond the screen. Once the ships are in place the screen should change so that combat can begin. I intend to have the player fire on a location by clicking on a square. Players will take turns and the computer will systematically sweep the board starting at a random square and cycling around a hit until the corresponding ships in the vicinity are sunk.
